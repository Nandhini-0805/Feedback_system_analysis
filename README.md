# Feedback_system_analysis
 Sentimental analysis and prediction using machine learning algorithm which predicts and analyses the feed back of faculties  of all department in an Institution 

Overview:

Its a simple machine learning problem to actually analyse whether the feedback of faculties given by their student for consecutive two years is positive or negative  and predict their future results.

Motivation:

I wanted to do a project for my institution something which is related my domain "machine learning".This is the real time data set which I got from my college to analyse the existing data and predict the future results

Technical Aspect:


-> This project is completely implemented in python


-> I have taken this as classification machine learning problem


-> Text pre processing was the biggest challenge as it is a real time data set


-> I have used frequency encoding and label encoding methods to convert the categorical features to numerical values


-> This project is completed done in Jupyter Notebook


-> I have done exploratory data analysis using heat map,pair plots ,bar chart using various libraries like seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot


-> In order to maintain confidentiality, the faculty names had been converted to staff code


->The accuracy of the project is 92%.


Algorithm mapping:


The classification algorithm I have used is **logistic regression**.Tried with several other algorithms like naive bayesian,but logistic regression showed me up a maximum accuracy of 92%
